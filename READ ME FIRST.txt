Hello, sorry for any mixups before, I had sent instructions with the application but for some reason they didn't show up, so here is the same again but this time with these instructions.

Load up Net Frank on a remote PC, the PC has to be either on a TCP/IP Network or online on the internet.  You will also need to know either the IP address or the friendly Network name of the PC, such as WORKSTATION6 or such like.

Once loaded you will not even know that it is there, that is the idea.

Connect to Net Frank on a different PC by using Hyperterminal on port 1002, to make sure that you are connected try a simple command such as "ver" without speech marks, this will report back the version number of Net Frank.  All of the other commands are stated below.

nfb "<0/1>"		Swaps mouse buttons			nfb "1"			None known
nfe 			Log off windows network			nfe			Will be replaced with a shutdown command
